# JetBrains
My settings for JetBrains IDEs.

It is not able to synchronize settings from *COMMUNITY* to *ULTIMATE* edition:

* Community Edition *DO NOT HAVE* IDE Settings Sync -> It doesn't sync plugins
* You should disable IDE Settings Sync plugin on Ultimate, but after enabling back settings will be downgraded
